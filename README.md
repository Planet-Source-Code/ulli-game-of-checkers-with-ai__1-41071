## Game of Checkers with AI


</div>

### Description

This is a game of Checkers which employs true alpha-beta pruning, iterative search deepening and principal variation move ordering. It runs to a ply of 12 to 18 analysing about 200,000 positions when given 30 seconds thinking time. I am not good at playing the game, so I don't know if it can be beaten - I haven't been able yet (with the planned moves list switched off) ;-[. The rules are included - found them somewhere on the WWW.

This is an updated version with a few bugs killed and with Conditional Compilation to implement the American Checkers Federation Rules (where the pieces do not jump backwards). Other updates include: board editing, problem solver mode (solving a 17-move problem in under five minutes), better graphics, and piece and square highlighting. Found this in one of my arcives, so I thought I might as well upload it again.
